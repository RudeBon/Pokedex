## Pokedex

The "Pokedex" project was developed with React.js and MobX as a test task. 
Ant.design UI library was used to create the app's design.
Open pokemon API (http://pokeapi.co/ *) was used to deliver data.
The pokemon list is displayed as cards with their names, avatars, stats and types as colored tags
A user can:
    *navigate through pages with cards and choose how much cards per page to display (10 / 20 / 50 / 100);
    *filter pokemons by type using tags (multiple selected tags show pokemons with any of the types selected);
    *filter pokemons by name with a search box;
    *click on a card to see additional information about pokemon
